# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use timer intervals, local storage, and to set attributes or append them through JavaScript.

Through this project, I also learned some new CSS techniques such as "turn" when making my gradient.

## Usage

To begin the quiz, click "start" on the main page. There will be a series of questions to answer. If you choose the incorrect answer, ten seconds will be subtracted from the timer. When all questions have been answered or time runs out, you will be prompted to input your initials. Your last attempt's score will be saved on the top of the screen.
